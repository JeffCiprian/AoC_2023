Sample 1:
0ms held = 0mm travelled over 7 ms
1ms held = 6mm travelled over 7 ms
2ms held = 10mm travelled over 7 ms
3ms held = 12mm travelled over 7 ms
*4ms held = 12mm travelled over 7 ms*
5ms held = 10mm travelled over 7 ms
6ms held = 6mm travelled over 7 ms
7ms held = 0mm travelled over 7 ms

needs to be > 9mm travelled

Sample 2:
0ms held = 0mm travelled over 15 ms
1ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
2ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
3ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
4ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
5ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
6ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
7ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
8ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
9ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
10ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
11ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
12ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
13ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
14ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms
15ms held = ?mm travelled over 15 ms

4*(7-4)=?

Formula:
distance travelled = speed*(total time - time held)
